  		<p><strong>The anaesthetics trainee:</strong></p>
		<p>This doctor has only one year left of her training.  
		<p>In 12 months she will be applying for posts as a consultant anaesthetist. 
		<p>During her 6yrs year training she has learned how to resuscitate acutely unwell patients in the emergency department and on wards, work in chronic pain services and lead intensive care units. 
		<p>She is a central part of the team needed to transfer acutely ill or severely injured patients between hospitals. 
		<p>You will hear why she chose anaesthetics, what her job entails and how she copes with caring for patients who are sometimes on the edge between life and death.
