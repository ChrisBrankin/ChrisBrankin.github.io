  		Surgery is the branch of medicine that deals with injuries, diseases and conditions that are treated with an operation or other procedure that opens up a body cavity or limb. </p>
  		<p>After their first few years as a general doctor, all surgeons begin the same initial surgical training. However later on, they specialise in a particular parts of the body. </p>
