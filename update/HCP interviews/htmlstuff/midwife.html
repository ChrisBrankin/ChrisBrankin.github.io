  		<p><strong>The Midwife:</strong></p>
		

<p>Midwives provide care and support to women and their families while pregnant, throughout labour and during the period after a baby’s birth. 
<p>Some midwives are nurses who have gone on to qualify as midwives and more recently it has been possible to train as a midwife without being a nurse.  
<p>Midwives, provide evidence-based information to women and help them make informed choices about the options and services available throughout their pregnancies.  
<p>Midwives provide:<ul>
    <li>provide full antenatal care, including parenting classes, clinical examinations and screening
    <li>identify high-risk pregnancies
    <li>monitor women and support them during labour and the birthing process 
    <li>teach new and expectant mothers how to feed, care for and bathe their babies </ul>
<p>They could be working with women from a variety of backgrounds and need to be confident enough to communicate with different people. 
<br>Some women and their families might be homeless, socially excluded, have disabilities or be very young. 
<br>Other clients may be from certain cultural or religious backgrounds.  
<p>All women will need midwives to understand the emotional, physical and psychological processes of pregnancy and birth. 
<br>Sometimes pregnancies do not go to plan and midwives offer support and advice on stillbirth, miscarriage, termination, neonatal death and neonatal abnormalities. 
<p>If you are working as a community midwife, you are likely to develop good professional relationships with your families, which can make counselling easier at difficult times.</p>
