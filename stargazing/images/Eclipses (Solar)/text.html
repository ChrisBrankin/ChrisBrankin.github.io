<p>Observing details of two total solar eclipses:<p>


Total Eclipse - Penzance - August 11 1999<p>
I arrived in Penzance at about 7.15am on the morning of the eclipse. <br>
This after a 12 hour train journey which had started at Crewe the previous evening and which seemed to call at all stations to Penzance via Ealing Broadway! <br>
No matter, the Sun was shining (just) and by 8.00am I was on the beach and I had set up my camera and taken a few practise shots. <br>
That was the last I saw of the Sun that day! Dark clouds drifted in from the west and by 10.00am it had begun to rain. <br>
This continued on and off until a few minutes before totality. <br>
As totality approached it got very dark, the darkness presumably enhanced by the cloud cover. 
<br>Street lights came on, flashlights went off and the front at Penzance reminded me of Blackpool illuminations on a cold, wet night. <br>
The seagulls flocked together screeching and to my mind seemed to be heading out to sea. It was like midnight, the only light that remained was a strange eerie yellow glow on the horizon.<br> 
People looked about bemused. Then all of a sudden night turned into day. As someone remarked, it was as if a dimmer switch had been turned on. It seemed to me a much more remarkable change in light level than at the beginning of totality, more clearly defined. 
<br>And that was that! Another 12 hour train journey to look forward to - but not before popping into a local - to watch the recorded highlights on TV.
<p>
Total Eclipse - Wuzhen (nr Shanghai), China - July 22 2009<p>

The total phase of the eclipse was visible only due to an amazing piece of good fortune. <br>
The hour leading up to totality had begun with skies overcast and a thin drizzle in the air and little hope of observing anything. <br>
Not wishing to be caught out in the seemingly unlikely event of the clouds lifting I set up my camera and put a plastic bag over the top. Thank goodness I did. <br>
Suddenly a small patch of pale blue sky appeared and was heading towards where the Sun ought to be. <br>
Then a few minutes before totality the nearly eclipsed Sun appeared behind this hazy patch. <br>
For the next few minutes until near the end of totality the eclipsed Sun was visible through varying amounts of hazy cloud sometimes totally obscured.<br>
 After totality the clouds thickened again and the Sun disappeared. <br>
 Getting exposures right in these conditions was pot-luck but at least I managed one shot of totality.
