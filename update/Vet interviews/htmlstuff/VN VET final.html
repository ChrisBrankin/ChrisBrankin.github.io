  		<p><strong>Mixed Practice Vet:</strong></p>
  		
  		<p>Vets in mixed practice not only work with small companion animals but also farm  animals (usually cows and sheep) and horses.  
  		<p>In addition to seeing companion animals in the surgery and performing all the roles of a small animal vet, they visit farms to undertake animal health testing, disease surveillance, treat sick/ injured animal and perform surgery, such as caesarean sections in the field. 
  		<p>They also work with farmers to put in place preventive health measures to prevent disease, improve animal welfare and reduce antibiotic use. 
		<p>Mixed practices often provide an out of hours emergency service for their clients, meaning a vet is available 24/7 365 days a year. 
		<p>They will be adept at the diagnosis and management of common problems across a wide range of species but will refer to specialists when required.
