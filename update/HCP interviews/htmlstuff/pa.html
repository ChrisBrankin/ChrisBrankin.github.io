  		<p><strong>The Physicians Associate:</strong></p>
		

<p>This is a new role to the UK health system but Physicians Associatess have been workig in other countries for some time. 
<p>Like specialist nurses, they undertake roles that are more usually done by a doctor.   
<p>Their role is similar to that of a junior doctor and they support doctors in the management of patients.  
<p>Here is a flavour of what their role entails:
<ul type="disc">	
				

    <li>taking medical histories from patients
    <li>performing physical examinations

    <li>diagnosing illnesses
    <li>seeing patients with long-term chronic conditions
    <li>performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures
    <li>analysing test results
    <li>developing management plans
    <li>providing health promotion and disease prevention advice for patients.
    
    </ul>
