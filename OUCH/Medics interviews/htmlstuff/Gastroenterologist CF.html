  		<p><strong>The Gastroenterologist:</strong></p>
		

<p>Doctors in this branch of medicine diagnose, treat and work to prevent gastrointestinal (stomach and intestines) and hepatological (liver, gallbladder, biliary tree and pancreas) diseases.  
<p>Because it is such a large area, doctors tend to specialised in one part of the gut.  
<p>They used endoscopes (flexible tubes through which camers and small operating instruments can be threaded) to visualise and in some instances, treat parts of the intestines and organs. 
<p>This is often the way that cancers of the bowel and stomach are first diagnosed. 
<p>Some gastroenterologists will work with surgeons in liver transplant services. 
<p>There are a number of other conditions which are life long and because of that,this group of doctors often have very long standing relationships with their patients.
