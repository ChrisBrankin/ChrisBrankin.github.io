  		<p><strong>The Anaesthetist:</strong></p>
		<p>Anaesthetists are the largest group of hospital-based specialists.  
		<p>They give anaesthetics for surgical, medical and psychiatric procedures. 
		<p>They also help pregnant women achieve pain free child-birth, resuscitate acutely unwell patients in the emergency department and on wards, run chronic pain services and lead intensive care units. 
		<p>They are a central part of the team needed to transfer acutely ill or severely injured patients between hospitals.  
		<p>Some will also attend the site of major trauma to begin to stabilise the patient before they get to hospital.
