<header>Observing details of two total solar eclipses</header>

<div class="hrule"></div>

<div class="cell"> <br><strong><br> Total Eclipse - Penzance - August 11 1999</strong><br> I arrived in Penzance at about 7.15am on the morning of the eclipse. This after a 12 hour train journey which had started at Crewe the previous evening and which seemed to call at all stations to Penzance via Ealing Broadway! No matter, the Sun was shining (just) and by 8.00am I was on the beach and I had set up my camera and taken a few practise shots. That was the last I saw of the Sun that day!   Dark clouds drifted in from the west and by 10.00am it had begun to rain. This continued on and off until a few minutes before totality. As totality approached it got very dark, the darkness presumably enhanced by the cloud cover. Street lights came on, flashlights went off and the front at Penzance reminded me of Blackpool illuminations on a cold, wet night. The seagulls flocked together screeching and to my mind seemed to be heading out to sea. It was like midnight, the only light that remained was a strange eerie yellow glow on the horizon. People looked about bemused.   Then all of a sudden night turned into day. As someone remarked, it was as if a dimmer switch had been turned on. It seemed to me a much more remarkable change in light level than at the beginning of totality, more clearly defined.   And that was that! Another 12 hour train journey to look forward to - but not before popping into a local - to watch the recorded highlights on TV.
<strong><p> Total Eclipse - Wuzhen (nr Shanghai), China - July 22 2009 </strong><br>The total phase of the eclipse was visible only due to an amazing piece of good fortune. The hour leading up to totality had begun with skies overcast and a thin drizzle in the air and little hope of observing anything. Not wishing to be caught out in the seemingly unlikely event of the clouds lifting I set up my camera and put a plastic bag over the top. Thank goodness I did. Suddenly a small patch of pale blue sky appeared and was heading towards where the Sun ought to be. Then a few minutes before totality the nearly eclipsed Sun appeared behind this hazy patch. For the next few minutes until near the end of totality the eclipsed Sun was visible through varying amounts of hazy cloud sometimes totally obscured. After totality the clouds thickened again and the Sun disappeared. Getting exposures right in these conditions was pot-luck but at least I managed one shot of totality.
