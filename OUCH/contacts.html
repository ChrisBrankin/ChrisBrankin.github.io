	  <p> Acknowledgements:

<p>This project has relied on the good will and generosity of many people.  
<p>Firstly, the many professionals who have given their time freely to reflect on their lives and share some very personal insights into their role.  Without exception, they were delighted to be able to help their successors. The real value of this resource is their contribution.

<p>Similarily, the resource could not have been produced without the patient technical expertise of Jack Wright who carefully edited the interviews and Chris Brankin who skillfully constructed the site - and its endless ammendments.  Both deserve a special mention for shepherding a tech novice through the process of production.

<p>Colleg Cambria encouraged the development of this video library and kindly supported it's co production by Sixth Form Curriculum Lead, Nora Richardson, someone with extensive experience on successfully preparing students for applications. Nora's expertise, optimism and enthusiasm was a quiet driving force behind the work, for which we are very grateful.
