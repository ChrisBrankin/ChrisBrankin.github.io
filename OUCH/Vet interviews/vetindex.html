		<p>Veterinary surgeons work to diagnose and treat sick animals across a range of different species. 
		<p>They are also involved in disease surveillance and managing disease outbreaks to protect both animal and human health. 
		<p>It’s a profession full of variety and the opportunities are diverse. Vets are healthcare professionals for the animal kingdom. 
		<p>One vet takes on roles carried out by many separate individuals in human medicine, such as surgery, radiology, prescribing and dispensing medicines and preventative healthcare – and on animal species from aardvarks to zebras.
		<p>The vets you will hear from work in a range of areas.  
		<p>These include small animal general practice, mixed practice and veterinary specialists.  
		<p>There are also some additional short videos that cover tips for getting work experience and how veterinary careers are structured.
