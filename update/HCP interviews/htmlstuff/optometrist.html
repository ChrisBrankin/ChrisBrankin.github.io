  		<p><strong>The Optometrist:</strong></p>
		

<p>The term optician includes people who fit and sell glasses and healthcare professionals who examine eyes and can prescribe corrective lenses. 
<p>The professionals who examine and prescribe are also known as optometrists. 
<p>An optometrist detects defects in vision, signs of injury, ocular diseases (diseases of the eye) or abnormality, and problems with general health. 
<p>Optometrists work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, high street optometrists, research, teaching, and other health settings.
<p>Optometrists who work in a high street practice examine the health of the eyes; offer clinical advice regarding eye health and vision correction; prescribe  and fit spectacles or contact lenses; make a referral for a specialist’s advice
<p>Those who work in a hospital or an eye clinic see patient in need of urgent care and are involved in more specialised areas of optometry such as treating and managing patients with glaucoma (an eye disease more common in black people and among the elderly) or macular degeneration, which is the most common cause of blindness in western society
