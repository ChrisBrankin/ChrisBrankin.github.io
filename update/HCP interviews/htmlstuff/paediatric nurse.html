<p>Children’s nurses look after young people from birth to 18yrs. 
Nursing a child is not just a question of caring for a small adult. 
Children have very specific health needs and these nurses  understand how a healthy child develops towards adulthood and so can minimise the impact of illness. 
This involves working in closely with the parents or guardians.
<p>Communication is a crucial factor when treating children. 
Adults can express their feelings but a child can’t communicate in the same way. 
Paediatric nurses are able to interpret children’s behaviour and reactions. 
Children's nurses can also spot when a child's health worsens, which can often happen rapidly. 
<p>A child’s care takes place in a range of settings including hospitals, day care centres, clinics and in the community in a child's home.  
<p>Children's nurses are part of multidisciplinary teams that look after patients. 
<p>They are at the centre of teams that include doctors, hospital play staff, healthcare assistants, newborn hearing screeners, psychologists and social workers.
