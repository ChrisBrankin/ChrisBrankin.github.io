  		<p><strong>The Vascular Surgeons:</strong></p>
		
<p>Vascular surgeons are trained to diagnose and manage conditions that affect the circulation, including disease of the arteries, veins and lymphatic vessels. 
<p>They treat all parts of the vascular system excluding the heart and the brain.
<p>Conditions such as ruptured aortic aneurysm and damage to blood vessels from trauma following road accidents, assaults and other accidents can be life threatening. About 40% of vascular patients arrive in hospitals as emergency cases. 
<p>This means that around 40-50% of their surgical work is likely to be emergency operations.
<p>They work very closely with a number of other specialties and often operate with other surgeons.
