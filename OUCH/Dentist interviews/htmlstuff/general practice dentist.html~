  		<p><strong>general dental practitioners:</strong></p>
		
<p>Dentists in general practice work with patients over the long term, often seeing members of the same family.  Their relationships with patients may last many years.
<p>They work with their patients to prevent and treat dental and oral disease. 
They are often the professionals who see the first signs of serious oral conditions and will refer patients to specialists for treatment. 
If patients present with very complex needs they will refer on to hospital consultants or other specialist dentists.
<p>Dentists are part of a team that includes dental nurses, hygeneists and dental therapists.
<p>Karen is an experienced dentist who has worked in a wide range of community settings.  Abbie is newly qualified and talks about the first few years in practice
