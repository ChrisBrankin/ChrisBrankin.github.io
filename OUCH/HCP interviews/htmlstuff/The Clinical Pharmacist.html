<p>Pharmacists are responsible for advising patients about medicines, including how to take them, what reactions may occur and answering patients' questions.  
<br>They also provide a safety system to ensure that patients receive the right medicines at the right dosage .  
<br>Pharmacists are able to offer advice on common illnesses and some can prescribe medication.  They will often advise other healthcare professionals on the best mediciness to use or in cases where a patient is taking a large number of medicines.:
<p>Pharmacists work in many different work environments. These include:
   <ul> 
   <li>Community pharmacies (sometimes called retail or high street pharmacy) and hospitals. Most pharmacists work in community and hospital pharmacy
   <li>Pharmaceutical production or sales in the pharmaceutical industry
    <li>Prisons, primary care organisations, universities in teaching and research, the military, veterinary pharmacy and pharmacy organisations.
    </ul>
