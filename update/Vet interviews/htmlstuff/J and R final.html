  		<p><strong>Small Animal General Practice:</strong></p>
  		
  		<p>These vets are the ones that most people think of when they think about veterinary practice.  
  		<p>Many will have practices in the local high street.  
  		<p>They look after companion animals, the majority of these are cats and dogs but can also include guinea pigs, rabbits and hamsters.  
  		<p>Some will offer care for birds and more exotic pets such as lizards and spiders.  
  		<p>They provide routine health care, disease screening and advice, manage chronic conditions and undertake the ‘routine’  surgeries, such as neutering, lump removals and taking x-rays.  
  		<p>Some will have additional expertise in specific areas.  
  		<p>They will refer to specialists for advice when needed and can refer animals onwards to referral units if they require more specialised care or procedures.
