  		<p>The term 'Junior doctor' refers to all doctors who are not consultants even though they may have been qualifed for many years. 
  		<p>The doctors you will hear from in this section have finished their 'basic training' as junior doctors and have decided on the area of medicine in which they would like to specialise. 
  		<p>They talk about their training and what life is like in the early years after qualifying as a doctor</p>
