	  	<p>The doctors will tell you what motivated them to choose medicine, what can be challenging about a career in medicine and how they cope, as well as the things that are the most fulfilling.</p>
  		<p>The medical students will tell you what it’s like to study medicine in a UK university and how they found the application process</p>
		<p>Finally, there are examples of how to answer the questions you can expect in the MMIs (Mini Medical Interviews) at UK medical schools. </p>
		<p>These final year medical students will demonstrate what not to do at an interview and will also show you what a good answer looks like. </p>
		<p>You may want to pause each video to discuss or make notes.
