  		<p><strong>The A&E trainee:</strong></p>
  		
  		
<p>Doctors who work in this area are dealing with patients who haven't expected to find themselves in hospital.  
<p>Patients may be seriously ill and have arrived in hospital in an ambulance or they may have been able to make their own way to hospital.  
<p>This group of doctors work to immediately stabilise seriously ill patients and to call on the appropriate specialists to admit the patient so the treatment the patient needs can begin.  
<p>They also treat less seriously ill patients themselves before sending them home.  
<p>This doctor has just started her training programme to become and A&E consultant.  
<p>It will take 6 years to complete and she will then spend several more years gaining experience. 
<p>During her training she will spend time learning about anaesthetics, intensive care, medical emergences, trauma and paediatric emergency medicine.
